Set::Associate::NewKey::PickOffset - Associate a key with a value from a pool based on the keys value as a numeric offset.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004002

=head1 METHODS

=head2 name

The name of this key assignment method ( C<pick_offset> )

=head2 get_assoc

Returns a value non-destructively by picking an item at numerical offset C<$new_key>

   my $value = $object->get_assoc( $set_assoc, $new_key );

B<Note:> C<$new_key> is automatically modulo  of the length of C<$set_assoc>, so offsets beyond end of array are safe, and wrap.
