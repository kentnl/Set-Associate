Set::Associate

Essentially, this is a simple toolkit to map an infinite-many items to a
corresponding finite-many values, i.e: A nick coloring algorithm.

The most simple usage of this code gives out values from "items"
sequentially, and remembers seen values and persists them within the
scope of the program, i.e:

    my $set = Set::Associate->new(
        on_items_empty => Set::Associate::RefillItems->linear(
            items => [qw( red blue yellow )],
        ),
    );
    sub color_nick {
        my $nick = shift;
        return colorize( $nick, $set->get_associated( $nick );
    }
    ...
    printf '<< %s >> %s', color_nick( $nick ), $message;

And this is extensible to use some sort of persisting allocation method
such as a hash

    my $set = Set::Associate->new(
        on_items_empty => Set::Associate::RefillItems->linear(
            items => [qw( red blue yellow )],
        ),
        on_new_key => Set::Associate::NewKey->hash_sha1,
    );
    sub color_nick {
        my $nick = shift;
        return colorize( $nick, $set->get_associated( $nick );
    }
    ...
    printf '<< %s >> %s', color_nick( $nick ), $message;

Alternatively, you could use 1 of 2 random forms:

    # Can produce colour runs if you're unlucky

    my $set = Set::Associate->new(
        on_items_empty => Set::Associate::RefillItems->linear(
            items => [qw( red blue yellow )],
        ),
        on_new_key => Set::Associate::NewKey->random_pick,
    );

    # Will exhaust the colour variation before giving out the same colour
    # twice
    my $set = Set::Associate->new(
        on_items_empty => Set::Associate::RefillItems->shuffle(
            items => [qw( red blue yellow )],
        ),
    );
