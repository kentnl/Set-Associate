 [API Changes]
 - Set::Associate should no longer be passed an `items` value, instead,
   those should be passed to the `on_items_empty` handler constructor.
 - `items` support temporarily forwarded for you till 0.3.0 at least
 - ::NewKey and ::RefillItems now only should have their sugars accessed
   via method style, ie: ::NewKey->linear_wrap()

 [Internals]
 - commmon code moved to a ::Utils file

 [minor bugfix]
 - I accidentally released the previous version with a version of
   Dist::Zilla that *wasn't* immune to v5.16 package declarations.
   Unfortunately, my patches haven't landed upstream yet, so working on a
   local build.
